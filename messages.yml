# LiteBans messages.yml generated by version 2.1.25
#
# The following variables can be used in most messages that involve a punishment:
#
# Punishment specific variables
# $id - The ID of the punishment in the database.
# $type - Type of punishment - ban, mute, warn, kick.
# $reason - the reason for the punishment
# $executor - the moderator's name, or their display name (/nick) if this is enabled in the configuration
# $executorUUID - the moderator's UUID
# $permanent - whether this ban is permanent
# $ipban - whether this is an IP-ban
# $silent - whether this was executed silently (-s)
#
# Punished player specific variables
# $playerDisplayName - player display name. If display names are not enabled in the configuration or if the player's display name is not available in the message's context, the player's regular name will be used instead.
# $playerName - player name, only available in certain contexts
# $playerUUID - UUID of punished player
# $playerIP - IP of punished player
# $geoip - Country of affected player, requires GeoIP to be enabled in the configuration, won't work with imported bans
#
# Dates
# Example format: "2017-02-03", depends on time_format
# $dateStart - date the punishment was placed
# $dateEnd - date the punishment will expire, "forever" if permanent
#
# Durations
# Example format: "20 days, 5 hours, 2 minutes". If permanent, "forever", if expired, "expired" (both are configurable).
# $duration - time until expiry
# $originalDuration - the full duration of the punishment.
# $timeSince - time since placement
#
# Placeholders
# These variables represent messages in this configuration (messages.yml)
# $base - banned_message_base
# $appealMessage - banned_message_appeal_message
#
# Global variables
# $activeBans, $activeMutes, $activeWarnings - total number of global active punishments
# $totalBans, $totalMutes, $totalWarnings - total number of global punishments (including inactive ones)
#
# Any message can be disabled by setting it to "". Empty messages will not be sent by the plugin.
